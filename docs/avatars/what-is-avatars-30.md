# 什麼是角色 3.0

## 什麼是角色3.0?

**啟用表情** 是 VRChat 的基本目標. 允許用戶創建、上傳和與他人共享他們的角色的其中的一個關鍵部分. 自從我們於 2017 年 2 月在 Steam 上推出以來，對角色系統進行了一些小更新.其中一些更新啟用了大量的創造力和表達能力, 但大多建立的表情功能都沒有完全的系統化，或是未來可進一步擴展角色系統。

除了我們現在為角色3.0實施的內容之外，我們還有更多其他重要的事情即將討論（:tm:），所有這些都建立在 角色3.0的基礎上。

### 動作選單的目標

When we sat down to look at revamping the Avatars SDK and related systems, it quickly became obvious that we needed a fluid UI that would compliment the vast possibilities the new underlying systems were going to allow. Having only eight emotes and some gesture animation overrides accessible through our current menu system were going to be far too limiting. We needed a menu that was full of “actions” and widgets that allowed you to quickly access all that new depth and creativity. We wanted to give people the ability to quickly perform those actions one handed and in a less obvious manner to those around you than the current Quick Menu > Emotes > Backflip system currently in place.

We wanted to make this system fun, fluid and editable. We also wanted to keep it simple to use so that anyone could enjoy it-- but powerful enough to enable far more expression than ever before. We had the additional goal of allowing it to work well with existing avatar expressions systems like the gesture animation override feature. Finally, we also wanted SDK2 avatars to work with it.

Quite a lot of thought, VRChat team and Closed Alpha tester feedback went into the design. It went through several very different versions before we found the right one. It’s built to:

* Be quick and easy to access.&#x20;
* Allow some muscle memory.&#x20;
* Be one-handed or two-handed as needed.&#x20;
* Allow physical “puppeteering” of avatar functionality.&#x20;
* Give people more information about the avatar they are inhabiting instead of having to try out gestures or guess what animations that avatar has.&#x20;
* House a great many more animations and features for an avatar.
* Allow combinations of actions that weren’t possible before, especially using two hands.&#x20;
* Be simple to understand yet allow lots of depth.
* Be somewhat customizable even in how it functions and appears depending on a user’s preferences and use-case context.&#x20;
* Overall help enable more creativity and avatar expression in VRChat!&#x20;

### We need and value your feedback!

At the end of the day, though, what matters most is what you-- the creators and users of VRChat-- think. We’d like people to take a look and try it out. Kick the tires! Give us your feedback! It’s probably best to get a quick hands-on look by grabbing an example avatar from [here](https://vrchat.com/home/world/wrld\_6168d07b-f55c-40bc-8077-749dde39983c), open the Action Menu by clicking on your joystick (or hold down your Menu button) and seeing how each avatar is using it to control that avatar. Once you’re ready, check out #av3-info on our Discord to find the current build and the latest SDK. When you’ve got some feedback to provide, please go [here](https://feedback.vrchat.com/avatar-30) to post your thoughts.

**Note:** Something we’d like you to keep in mind is that the Action Menu and Avatars 3.0 SDK is powerful but new. It’s true power will become more apparent as more creators build more avatars with it. This is the hope for the Open Beta. To get more people using the system and making things with it. The examples we’ve shipped with are very fundamental. Almost like shipping with Nikei as a first example avatar compared to the incredible creations people have made for VRChat over time.

We hope you enjoy helping us test this out and giving us feedback as much as we have had building this new system for you.

Thank you!

The VRChat Dev Team
